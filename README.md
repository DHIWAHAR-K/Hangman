# Hangman Game

## Overview

This Python script implements a classic Hangman game where the player needs to guess a word selected randomly from a predefined list. The game provides a limited number of attempts for the player to guess the word correctly.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Enter your name when prompted.
3. The game will start, and you need to guess the word by entering individual letters.
4. You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
5. After each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn.
6. If you correctly guess the word or make too many incorrect guesses, the game will prompt you to play again.
