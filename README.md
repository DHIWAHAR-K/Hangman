#This Python script implements a classic Hangman game where the player needs to guess a word selected randomly from a predefined list. The game provides a limited number of attempts for the player to guess the word correctly.

#How to Play
Run the script in a Python environment.
Enter your name when prompted.
The game will start, and you need to guess the word by entering individual letters.
You have a limited number of incorrect guesses before the game ends.
After each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn.
If you correctly guess the word or make too many incorrect guesses, the game will prompt you to play again.
Files
hangman.py: The main Python script containing the Hangman game implementation.
README.md: This file providing an overview and instructions for the game.

#Dependencies
The script uses the following Python standard libraries:
1. random: For random word selection.
2. time: For introducing delays in the game.

#Word List
The game includes a predefined list of words that the player can guess. Feel free to modify or expand this list within the script to add more words.
words_to_guess = ["january", "border", "image", ...]

#Running the Game
Execute the script in a Python environment:
python hangman.py

#Game Logic
The script includes functions for game initialization, playing the game, and handling the game loop. The hangman ASCII art is displayed based on the number of incorrect guesses.
def main():
    # ... (initialize game)

def play_loop():
    # ... (prompt to play again)

def hangman():
    # ... (game logic)


main()
hangman()
